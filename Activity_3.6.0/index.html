  <p>Even though I work in IT, 2 of my hobbies are home automation and my home lab. I use google home and Home assistant as my home automation hubs
    where I can interact with most of my home. I can turn on/off most of my lights, set my thermostat and configure automations. I also like
    to host my own services if I can. I have built a 3 node proxmox cluster which runs a couple of VM's that run docker and some containers. One docker 
    container is a port of VSCode that runs on a website. This VSCode container is what I am using as an IDE for this class. Both home automation
    and my home lab can be very time consuming as they evolve very quickly. They both need constant updates and I seem to be always adding new things
    as time goes on. I like the challenges as well as the reward when things work they way I want and I get to use them.
